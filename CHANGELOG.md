# Changelog

All notable changes to `pr-reviewer` and `pr-fixer`. Both skills ship together under one version.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## 0.1.0

First tracked release.

### Added

- `scripts/check-version.sh` in both skills. It prints one notice when a newer release exists and
  never installs anything. Opt out with `PR_SKILLS_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`.
- `metadata.version` in each `SKILL.md`, a root `VERSION` file and this changelog.
- `review-cycle.sh halt` and the `review:needs-human` label, set over `review:blocked` when the
  loop pauses or stops and a person has to decide.

### Changed

- The skills moved to `.agents/skills/`. Workflow templates and prompts call that path.

### Removed

- The `review:ready-to-merge` label. It repeated `review:passed`.
